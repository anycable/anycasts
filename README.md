# AnyCasts

This repository is used to plan new AnyCasts episodes.

The flow is the following:
- Ideas/suggestions go to [Discussions](https://github.com/anycable/anycasts/discussions)
- Approved/selected ideas go to [Issues](https://github.com/anycable/anycasts/issues)
- The [Project](https://github.com/orgs/anycable/projects/5) is used to track the production.
